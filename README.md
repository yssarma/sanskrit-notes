## Self Introduction of Y. S. Sarma with whose efforts this study material is prepared.

Dear Reader, 
I am a Civil Engineer. During my high school studies I had Hindi as one of the subjects. Also I have passed PRAVESIKA hindi examination conducted by Dakshina Bharat Hindi Prachara Sabha, Madras. Hence I have knowledge on Devanagari Lepi. But I am unaware of sanskrit language. 

In 2002, I joined Samskruta Bharati organization as a student to learn Sanskrit. I hvae learnt the Vyakaranam and also conducted spoken sanskrit classes and vyakaranam for about 2 years. In 2004, I appeared the entrance examination conducted by SAMSKRUTA VIDYA PEETAM, a deemed university for vedas and vedangas being taught in sanskrit as a medium of instructions for regular and distance education courses. This is located in Tirupati, a university under central government in the ministry of HR. I passed the exam (first class) and taken Acharya (MA) with Phalita Jyotishyam as a subject in 2004-2006. 

From 2006-2008, I attended many courses on Jyotishyam and Vyakaranam. During this period, I worked as a part time Sanskrit lecturer and taught sanskrit to degree students.

Again in 2008-2010, I have undergone course Acharya (MA) in sanskrit sahithyam from the same university and again passed in first class. 

But then I had a feeling that I could not learn the sanskrit language from the root level. So, I have joined a 6 month course privately which is based on Astadhyaee method. This is as per the book SAMSKRUTA PATHANA PAATHANA VIDHI by Sri Brahmadatta Gigjnasu, a well experienced sanskrit scholar in Astadhyaee method in gurukulas. This is designed in forty-four lessons. That is grammer on Kriya Siddhi for those who cannot attend gurukulas for regular courses. This is a short course. Here I learnt the Siddhi Prakriya and I am happy over it. The teacher who had taught this book also did not do the 2nd part, i.e. on Sabdas. With my previous experience, I did the 2nd book, i.e., Sidhi Prakriya on Sabdas in about 6 months at home.
